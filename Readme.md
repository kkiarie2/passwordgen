I built this password generator using Html, css and vanilla JS.
This app generates random 13 character passwords consisting of uppercase, lowercase, 0-9 integers, and symbols
js concepts used include for loops generating random numbers
More modifications coming up ie ability set the lenghth and 1 click copy
